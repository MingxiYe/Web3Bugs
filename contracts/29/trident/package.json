  "description": "TRIDENT ðŸ”± is a newly developed AMM and routing system from [SushiSwap](https://sushi.com/) (Sushi). Trident is not a fork of any existing AMM, though to start, it incorporates popular AMM concepts into a single, upgradeable framework. The Sushi core team began development with [Andre Cronje](https://github.com/andrecronje) as [Deriswap](https://andrecronje.medium.com/deriswap-capital-efficient-swaps-futures-options-and-loans-ea424b24a41c). This development continued on as [Mirin](https://github.com/sushiswap/mirin) developed by [LevX](https://github.com/levx-io). On May 12th, 2021, Sushi began building Trident in earnest on the Mirin/Deriswap foundation.",
